## Making Progress in iTELL 

### Pages

The textbook's contents are divided into Pages. You can access different Pages using the left-side navigation bar.

Below is an overview of a Page in iTELL.

<i-image
  style="aspect-ratio:1756/875;"
  src="https://pxeblicvfnzlnounkznu.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/strapi/files/userguide_prolific_2.png-52541f2f2b5fd9f9cdc2d757594117c8.png"
  alt="userguide_prolific_2.png"
  width="1756"
  height="875">

What each Page looks like.

</i-image>

1\. The progress bar (in blue) shows how far you have scrolled down the page.

2 The left hand navigation bar will have links to different Chapters and Sections within the Module. Pages with checkmarks mean that you have completed those pages. Pages with locks mean that you have to complete the preceding page to unlock those pages.

3\. Click on the "Write summary" link to move to the bottom of the page where the Summary-writing activity is located.

5 Click on the "Back to top" link to move to the top of the page.

6 The right hand navigation bar contains links to subsections within the current page.

7\. iTELL AI is a conversational agent that is available to discuss the page that you are currently reading. To interact with iTELL AI, click on the chat box in the bottom right of your screen.

### Making Progress

Most iTELL pages will have one more short answer questions and a single summary writing activity at the end of the page. You will not be able to proceed to the next page without successfully completing all tasks on your current page.

#### Read

Most of the content in a page will be blurred at the beginning. As you read through the page, click on the red button that reads "Click here to continue reading" to _unblur_ the next section and continue reading.

<i-image
  style="aspect-ratio:1764/916;"
  src="https://pxeblicvfnzlnounkznu.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/strapi/files/userguide_read.png-c1a7354292f6d8c1752a2db49b310f20.png"
  alt="userguide_read.png"
  width="1764"
  height="916">

Unblur the next section by clicking on the red button when you are ready to continue.

</i-image>

#### Answer Questions

Sometimes you will see "Click here to see question" button. After clicking the button, you will provide a brief explanation of a concept to demonstrate your understanding of the text that you have read.

<i-image
  style="aspect-ratio:1655/709;"
  src="https://pxeblicvfnzlnounkznu.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/strapi/files/userguide_prolific_3.png-e99bc454865d0932cd68974e52babef9.png"
  alt="userguide_prolific_3.png"
  width="1655"
  height="709">

 You will need to answer the constructed response item first to unblur the next section.

</i-image><i-image
  style="aspect-ratio:1732/755;"
  src="https://pxeblicvfnzlnounkznu.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/strapi/files/userguide_prolific_4.png-c2b8adad9e165ca16abb58b51e323fd5.png"
  alt="userguide_prolific_4.png"
  width="1732"
  height="755">

Submitting the correct answer to the constructed response item will unlock the next section.

</i-image>

![userguide_prolific_5.png](https://pxeblicvfnzlnounkznu.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/strapi/files/userguide_prolific_5.png-0e7c064377390dff9c73547c4b0cba86.png)

After submitting an incorrect answer, you can try to revise your answer and resubmit by clicking on the "Resubmit" button. You can also click on the "Reveal Answer" button to reveal the correct answer, or click on the "How can I improve my answer?" button to receive a more detailed feedback. You can also choose to skip the question by clicking on "Skip this question".

#### Write a Summary

A summary writing activity is located at the bottom of each page. After you answer all short answer questions on the current page, you will be asked to summarize the contents of the page before you can move on to the next page. Write a summary and submit it to receive feedback.

<i-image
  style="aspect-ratio:1827/890;"
  src="https://pxeblicvfnzlnounkznu.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/strapi/files/userguide_summary.png-94b2571a4d1ad8a41db7843316ef7f7f.png"
  alt="userguide_summary.png"
  width="1827"
  height="890">

The summary feature is disabled until you finish reading the whole page and answer all constructed response items on the page.

</i-image>

### Evaluation

Your summary will be evaluated according to four metrics:

**Content**: Whether your summary shows good coverage of the page's main points and provides details to support those points.

**Language Borrowing**: Whether you have written the summary in your own words or borrowed language from the text.

**Relevance**: Whether the topics and ideas discussed in your summary are sufficiently relevant to the content of the page.

### Feedback

If your summary fails to pass the evaluation, you will be given additional attempts to revise and resubmit your summary. Click on the \_Details\_ tab to access more detailed feedback to help you write a better summary.

<i-image
  style="aspect-ratio:1600/803;"
  src="https://pxeblicvfnzlnounkznu.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/strapi/files/userguide9.png-92883764442f9253d2e5e302af350d83.png"
  alt="userguide9.png"
  width="1600"
  height="803">

Summaries that do not receive a passing grade will be given detailed feedback.

</i-image>

### Re-reading

If your summary fails to pass the evaluation, iTELL's conversational agent (iTELL AI) will analyze your summary and redirect you to a section of the page. You will then re-read this section, discuss it with iTELL AI, and finally return to revise your summary.

### Notes

Your past summaries will be accessible from your dashboard.

### Starting a Conversation

iTELL provides a conversational agent that will answer any questions related to the textbook. Click on the module located at the bottom right of the screen to start

<i-image
  style="aspect-ratio:1756/875;"
  src="https://pxeblicvfnzlnounkznu.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/strapi/files/userguide_prolific_2.png-52541f2f2b5fd9f9cdc2d757594117c8.png"

 iTELL AI's module is located at the bottom right side of the screen (7)

</i-image>

### Assisted Re-reading

If you submit a summary that does not pass the evaluation, iTELL AI will automatically redirect you to a part of the textbook that you should re-read to improve your understanding of the reading material and to write a better summary.

<i-image
  style="aspect-ratio:1866/618;"
  src="https://pxeblicvfnzlnounkznu.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/strapi/files/userguide_iTELLAI_2.png-883ce418b3b154755ec93c123920d317.png"
  alt="userguide_iTELLAI_2.png"
  width="1866"
  height="618">

iTELL AI will redirect you to a relevant chunk

</i-image>

Make sure to spend enough time re-reading the highlighted text. Click on the \`I'm ready for question\` button when you are ready to answer a question about the passage.

<i-image
  style="aspect-ratio:1467/616;"
  src="https://pxeblicvfnzlnounkznu.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/strapi/files/userguide_iTELLAI_3.png-3b482b2f06cbfcf039a54a67fcd40be1.png"
  alt="userguide_iTELLAI_3.png"
  width="1467"
  height="616">

iTELL AI will ask you a question about the highlighted passage.

</i-image>

Answer the question and engage in a conversation with iTELL AI to gain a better understanding of the passage. Once you feel that you have a better understanding of the text, click on the \`Return to summary\` button to go back to the summary module and rewrite your summary. After responding to iTELL AI's question, you can continue to engage with iTELL AI, or go back to the summary module

iTELL AI will only automatically redirect you for re-reading once per page. If you submit more summaries that fail the evaluation, you will have the choice to manually engage in this re-reading activity by clicking on the \`See question\` button. Please note that this button will only appear if you submit a **failing** summary.

<i-image
  style="aspect-ratio:1681/738;"
