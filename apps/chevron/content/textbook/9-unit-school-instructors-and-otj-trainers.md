The UFT maintains an Instructor Directory which is a list of instructors and the unit schools and CRO schools each instructor is eligible to teach. The directory is made available to STLs when Instructors are needed, to ensure the most eligible and available HO/Operator is selected to conduct training.

## 9.2 On-the-Job Trainer {#92-On-the-Job-Trainer-2070} 

The STL will designate a qualified OTJ trainer to conduct Shadow Training. A qualified OTJ trainer is a Qualified Operator on the specified job. Use of an operator trainee as an OTJ is not recommended; however, business needs may dictate such. The OTJ Trainer is assigned to work with the Trainee/Operator during the Shadow Training phase.

A trainee/operator is under the guidance of the trainer and assigned crew. The trainee/operator is not responsible for other jobs during this phase of training. They may participate in job related activities under direction and in the presence of the assigned trainer. A trainee/operator may walk through the plant unescorted during the break-in phase, however, they will not perform any job-related activities unless under the direct supervision of the assigned trainer. 

The trainer will use the Break-in Guide (Solo Checklist) as a guide during Pre-Job School and Post Job School Shadow. Other tools that may be used include the Electronic Operating Manual, Daily Turnovers, P&IDs, etc.
