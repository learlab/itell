## 6 Requalification – Absence from Job {#6-Requalification-Absence-from-Job-2063 .sr-only} 

The STL is responsible for ensuring direct reports job qualifications remain current based on previously defined requirements.

The matrix below is provided for specific re-qualification requirements and is based on length of absence from the job. A Board of Review, KR-100, is required to determine details of re-qualification requirements. Training required to re-establish qualification may vary. For example, an operator is placed on special assignment for 18 months and the assignment is within their assigned business unit, then a minimum amount of re-training may be necessary. On the contrary, an operator who has been physically absent from their assigned business unit for more than 18 months may require more in-depth re-training. Some examples of re-training below can stand alone or be combined with others to ensure competency is achieved: 

* Review all MOCs and procedure updates occurred during absence **(REQUIRED)**
* Shadow Training with a qualified Operator for a specified period
* Solo on the job for a specified period
* Complete all or a portion of the various checklists, skill assessments, or exams
* Attend Job School

Upon completion of requirements determined by the Board of Review, the employee will be considered re-qualified and allowed to resume job duties. All documentation related to each job re-qualification, including a KR-982, is forwarded to the LMS Specialist in L&D for electronic credit and is then filed in Central Records.

| Position | Reason for Loss | Re-qualification Requirements |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Trainees | Does not work a job for two 12-hour shifts within 12 months | To be determined by the trainee’s STL, and the Operations O&M Training Team Lead. |
