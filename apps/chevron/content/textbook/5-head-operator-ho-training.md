## 5.2 HO Work-Up Training: {#52-HO-Work-Up-Training-2050} 

Shift Team Leaders and Head Operators identify high potential Fully Qualified Operators who have the necessary experience, skills, and abilities to be eligible to work-up as Head Operator.

#### 5.2.1 Work-up Head Operator Checklist

Shift Team Leaders will make the requirements of this checklist and Head Operator job duties known to the Operators, in advance, so they will know what is expected of them to work-up as Head Operator. Upon completion of the Work-up Head Operator Checklist, the Operator will be eligible to work-up as Head Operator.  This checklist must be completed within one year of beginning their learning journey.

The checklist is forwarded to the LMS Specialist for electronic credit in LMS and proper filing.

## 5.3 HO Training: {#53-HO-Training-757} 

The Head Operator Leadership Training Program focuses on improving interpersonal and leadership skills, aligning with We Lead leader expectations and promoting Operational Excellence. Newly promoted Head Operators and high potential work-up HOs are enrolled in the program by the Development Specialist in L&D.

## 5.4 HO Transfer Field Training: {#54-HO-Transfer-Field-Training-2051} 

1.  Complete Orientation/Overview of all plants associated with a specific Console, including shadowing with HO or FQO to become familiar with outside equipment and processes in the plants associated with that console. (Minimum of 2 shifts on each job)
2.  Attend a Unit School that covers and incorporates outside plants associated with that console. (Minimum of 24 hours)
3.  Complete Post Unit School Shadow Training on outside jobs (Minimum of 2 shifts per outside job). using Solo and Qualification Checklists as supplemental training tools. (May require more or less time, depending on complexity of plants and HOs prior experience).

## 5.5 HO Transfer Console Training {#55-HO-Transfer-Console-Training-2052} 

1.  After completing Initial HO training requirements, Transferee moves inside for console training. Shadow on console for a minimum of fourteen 12-hour shifts within a two month period.
2.  The Transferee must complete Solo Checklist administered by the Control Room Operator.
3.  Transferring HO is now eligible to work as HO for plants that are controlled by that console.
4.  Once Transferring HO completes all training associated with first console, training may begin on other outside plants associated with the second console by repeating Steps 1 through 6. This process continues until Transferee is qualified on entire assigned area.

All training documents along with a KR-981, indicating the HO job title and code, are forwarded to the LMS Specialist for electronic credit in LMS and proper filing.

## 5.6 HO – Maintaining CRO Qualification {#56-HO-Maintaining-CRO-Qualification-2053} 

After 12 months without working a console the HO will no longer be considered qualified. The HO can maintain CRO qualification by periodically working the console and participating in required training through the normal course of business without creating overtime (e.g. have a work-up HO work outside while the HO works the console). Requirements to retain CRO qualification is defined as follows: 

Work a minimum of one 12-hour shift per quarter on each console in the business unit or complete one 10-hour session on the console simulator if available. With STL approval HOs and CROs may complete the 12-hour shift while shadowing with a qualified CRO. This is due to process and DCS changes that may have occurred to ensure this training is completed in a safe manner.
