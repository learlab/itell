## 2 Formal Operator Training Program (FOTP) {#2-Formal-Operator-Training-Program-FOTP-714 .sr-only} 

The Formal Operator Training Program is a three-year program designed to develop the required skills, knowledge, and competencies of new hire operators. **Any deviation to program content or required times must be approved by the business unit Area Section Head and documented on a KR-988, Training Program Waiver form. This waiver is used for extenuating circumstances and requests are considered by the Area Section Head on a case-by-case basis.**

_NOTE: Operator Trainees are not eligible to apply for other posted positions._

This training program incorporates the following: 

* Global Formal Operator Training Program (GFOTP)
* On-the-Job (OTJ) Training
* Qualification Activities

## 2.1 Trainee: Training Process Overview {#21-Trainee-Training-Process-Overview-1926} 

The following diagram illustrates the process by which new hire Operators advance through the qualification process as they move from an initial new hire trainee to a Fully Qualified Operator (FQO).

## 2.2 Trainee: Job Training Time Requirements {#22-Trainee-Job-Training-Time-Requirements-1927} 

A trainee must complete all required GFOTP courses, OTJ training, and Qualification Activities associated with four individual jobs to become a Fully Qualified Operator (FQO). Trainees must qualify on the first job within 12 months of hire date, and on the second job within 24 months of hire date. Jobs three and four must be completed within 36 months of hire date. **Non-vacation approved absences may** **result in an extension of the training period. Extensions are considered on a case-by-case basis. The STL consults with the HRBP to determine length of extension, if any.  A Training Program Waiver form, KR-988, must be approved by the Area Section Head indicating circumstances, length of extension if any, and pay progression advances or holds until requirements are met.**

## 2.4 Unit Job Training – Break In {#24-Unit-Job-Training-Break-In-1929} 

#### 2.4.1 Pre-Unit School Shadow Training

This component is comprised of seven uninterrupted 12-hour shifts and is required prior to first job unit school. During this period, a job qualified operator is assigned to work with the trainee. The trainee observes the operator to learn and gain first-hand experience of the plant, processes, hazards, and operator responsibilities.

#### 2.4.2 Unit School

Unit School training is required for each job. The unit school’s emphasis is placed on the Electronic Operating Manual (EOM) for each specific plant.

Unit School Duration

The minimum duration for unit schools is determined by the Unit School Scheduled Hours matrix published online. 

Unit School Logistics

Unit schools shall be conducted off-shift. During unit schools, the instructor and the student are relieved of job responsibilities, unless responding to a unit emergency. Unit schools must be conducted in a classroom setting allowing time for field reinforcement. Daily training schedules are established, and activities are developed to meet objectives. 

Unit School Exceptions

The Unit School may address more than one job where operating plants are inter-related and approved by area leadership. In these instances, OTJ training requirements and qualification events may be combined.

#### 2.4.3 Post Job School Shadow Training

Post job school job shadowing is required for each job. This comprises of ten to fifteen uninterrupted 12-hour shifts for the first job. Subsequent jobs require shadow training with length to be determined by the STL in consultation with crew Head Operators. During post job school shadow training, the Break-in Guide (Solo Checklist) must be completed.

#### 2.4.4 Break-in Guide (Solo Checklist)

The break-in guide is required for each job and used by the trainer to instruct on plant operations, potential hazards, routine duties, equipment, and procedures. It may be used during pre-job school shadow training as a guide prior to attending unit school. 

#### 2.4.5 STL Solo Assessment

Upon completion of the break-in guide (solo checklist), the STL evaluates the operator trainee. This evaluation will determine the trainee’s knowledge and understanding of the job. Once the STL Solo Assessment is completed successfully, the trainee is allowed to work the job solo.

## 2.5 Unit On-the-Job (OTJ) Training {#25-Unit-On-the-Job-OTJ-Training-1930} 

#### 2.5.1 Working Solo

Working solo is a term used to denote the operator trainee can safely and competently work the job without a shadow trainer. Working solo does NOT mean the trainee is qualified on a job. While working solo on a job, the trainee continues to complete additional OTJ training and qualification requirements. Refer to PEP154 Overtime Administration, Operations for information regarding overtime eligibility.

#### 2.5.2 Situation Problems

Situation problems require the trainee to interpret, analyze and evaluate the information presented, determine the cause of problem, arrive at a solution, and determine the result. Completion of 15 situation problems is required.

#### 2.5.3 Field Tests

Field Tests require demonstration of ability to competently perform normal or emergency operator duties. Circumstances may prevent the actual performance of a field test and as a result, some field tests will require an oral explanation of actions while in the field. Completion of 10 field tests is required.

#### 2.5.4 Yellow-Lining: Piping & Instrument Diagrams (P&IDs)

All trainees are required to “walkout” lines on P&IDs to learn plant process and equipment. P&IDs are completed while working solo. Permanent changes incorrectly displayed on the P&ID should be noted using the following conventions:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Yellow | Existing piping, vessels, controls and instrumentation are correctly displayed |
| Green | Additions to plant are not indicated |
| Red | Deletions from plant are still being displayed |

Completed P&IDs are presented to the HO for review and field verification and approval of markups. The HO will work with the STL to create an MOC for requested changes. 

Follow these steps to have P&IDs online updated:

1.  Operator Trainee: completes as-built markup
2.  Head Operator: Review/verify/approve markups. Verify changes are not temporary. Work with STL to create an MOC. Deliver markups to the DE Team Leader.
3.  Designs Engineer: Review markups and coordinate with IED if needed. Validate associated P&IDs/data. Create a DEW-IT task for Drafting and work the internal process. Verify updated P&IDs are published. Close DE MOC Action. Notify Head Operator.

## 2.6 Unit Job Qualification Activities {#26-Unit-Job-Qualification-Activities-1931} 

#### 2.6.1 Qualification Checklist

Qualification checklists are designed to evaluate the knowledge acquired by the operator trainee through the completion of all previous OTJ training requirements. 

#### 2.6.2 Final Qualification Exam (FQE)

_(Pre-requisite: All training documents required for Unit Job Qualification and a completed KR-981 is complete.) _

This examination is only required for trainees as they qualify on their first four jobs. To complete the FQE, the trainee notifies the STL and UFT. The STL or UFT ensures all training requirements are completed. The STL or UFT contacts the M&P Specialist for a secure test copy. The UFT, STL, or Head Operator may proctor the FQE while following the testing protocol below: 

Closed Book

* Tests are closed book. The employee is not permitted to bring any written material, electronic communication devices, or personal belongings into the testing environment.
* Employee can retrieve personal belongings once the test is completed.

Examinee Instructions:

* Employee must pass with a score of 80%.
* Employee is expected to write complete answers to all questions about the equipment, process and routine duties in detail.
* Tests will contain 30 - 50 questions with a 5-hour time limit, including four 15 min. breaks. Employee is not allowed to leave testing site during breaks.
* Questions not completed due to time restrictions will be marked as incorrect.

Test Proctor Instructions:

* Final qualification tests will be proctored in a controlled setting. The location of proctoring exams may differ slightly in each operating area due to the availability of office space. The proctor will provide the best setting available at the time of the requested exam, which could be a shared space with the proctor, or a space in an office alone. If there is a need to proctor a 2nd attempt FQE, it is recommended to reserve a space in the PNC complex for the benefit of both the test taker and proctor to be free from potential distractions of the operating unit.
* Proctor can provide clarification about the intent of a question but will not provide answers or clues.
* Proctor will not allow copies of the test to leave the controlled environment.
* Unit Field Trainer or STL or Designee will grade the test and notify STL of score.
* Unit Field Trainer will analyze test results and recommend additional training to ensure 100% comprehension.

#### 2.6.3 Qualification Review Board (QRB)

After a successful FQE, and **prior to beginning training on another job**, the QRB meets with the trainee to review training documentation and conduct the interview of the employee. The interview verifies the employee has the necessary knowledge to perform the current job safely and competently. Five primary elements of the QRB include Safety, Environmental Considerations, Process Safety Information, Process Flow and Control, and Safety Instrumented Systems. The [KR-984, Qualification Review Board](https://www.pasms.chevron.net/forms/KR984.pdf) form provides more detail. QRB attendees are as follows:

| Position | Role |
| --- | --- |
| RBM / ASH (or designee)<br><br>Required | Ensures the integrity of the process, scores and provides the final decision of advancement or hold. |
| STL<br><br>Required | Ensures all training documentation is complete, and pre-requisite activities have been completed. Facilitates the interview, asks questions, scores, provides feedback on scoring and documents results on KR-984. |
| Head Operator<br><br>Required | Participates by asking questions and scores. |
| UFT<br><br>Required | Participates by asking questions and scores. Provides requested training records and supporting documentation for review. Collects completed training package and delivers to LMS Specialist. |
| Refinery Shift Manager<br><br>Attendance Optional<br><br>Invite Required | Observes a sampling of QRBs to audit for quality and consistency in application across all Operations areas. Provides feedback to Operations Leadership about the health of the overall QRB process. May ask questions of the trainee during the QRB. |
| L&D Representative<br><br> <br><br>Optional | Attends at the request of the business unit. Serves as an observer of the process and may provide feedback on the facilitation of the QRB or performance of the candidate during the QRB. |

Table 3: QRB Roles

Upon successful completion of the QRB, the trainee is considered job qualified. The UFT forwards the completed training package to the LMS Specialist.  The LMS Specialist files the original hard copy training material and gives electronic credit.

## 2.7 Maintaining Qualification {#27-Maintaining-Qualification-715} 

To maintain qualification, the trainee must work a minimum of two 12-hour shifts in each qualified job in any 12-month period.
