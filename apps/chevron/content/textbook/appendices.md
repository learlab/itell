## Appendix B: Accelerated Program {#Appendix-B-Accelerated-Program-795} 

An individualized training program is available for former Pascagoula operator re-hires and Chevron operator transfers from other locations. 

### Eligibility {#eligibility}

With Area Section Head approval, transferees from other Chevron facilities are able to remain at the level they bring to the refinery from their previous location. Chevron Operations re-hires must have a minimum of 3 years of experience to be considered as eligible for this accelerated development program.

### Placement in the Program {#placement-in-the-program}

Placement in the program occurs through nomination by the supervisor or ASH and documented on a KR-988 Training Program Waiver form. L&D will present an individual accelerated plan (IAP) to Business Unit management to include restrictions, timelines and milestones. If approved, the O&M Training Team Lead or designee will meet with the candidate along with candidate’s STL and ASH to develop the appropriate path forward. 

### Performance Expectations {#performance-expectations}

Participants in the accelerated program will be assessed using the same standards that are applied to their counterparts participating in the traditional program.

### Advancement through the Program {#advancement-through-the-program}

Advancement through the program is based on successful completion of the requirements included in the IAP. The supervisor is responsible for implementing and executing the IAP including notifying HR when requesting movement in pay progression. 

### Failures {#failures}

In the event a participant is unable to successfully complete one or more of the activities outlined in the IAP, a Board of Review will be convened to determine the appropriate course of action, which could include removal from the accelerated program, placing the participant on a PIP, or termination.

## Appendix C: FOTP Curriculum Change Request {#Appendix-C-FOTP-Curriculum-Change-Request-796} 

L&D conducted a Lean Sigma Kaizen Event on the Operations on-boarding process in 2019. Over the years the process expanded to an 11-week program as guest speakers, special interest groups, and peripheral trainers sought a captive audience in which to address their respective topics. To return to the original intent of the on-boarding process and provide operations with a quality product, which is a trainee prepared with basic knowledge and skills about operating processes and equipment, many of the non-value added and non-critical topics and presenters have been removed from the program. To provide further structure and guidance to the training program, the following Curriculum Change Request process will be implemented: 

### Curriculum Change Request Process: {#curriculum-change-request-process}

1.  Requestor submits KR-235 to the FOTP Coordinator. Request must include:
    1.  business justification
    2.  anticipated impact on current training schedule
        1.  how the change will improve new hire operator competency
2.  If accepted, the FOTP Coordinator utilizes available tools and resources to implement the change.
3.  If additional time is added to the schedule due to change, L&D Manager notifies the Area Section Heads.
