## 8 Interns {#8-Interns-763 .sr-only} 

This section describes the requirements established to onboard interns who have either recently completed, or in the process of completing, an Industrial Operations or Maintenance program at an area community college.

To be considered as a qualified candidate for the Pascagoula Refinery Internship program, students must have completed a degree in an Operations Process Technology or equivalent program, maintain a 3.0 grade point average, and successfully complete Chevron’s pre-hire requirements.

## 8.1 Selection Process {#81-Selection-Process-764} 

Human Resources and Learning and Development completes the screening process for qualified intern candidates. Pre-hire requirements for an intern are the same as a full-time trainee hire. 

The number of interns will be determined by business needs. The Area Section Heads determine crew assignments for operations interns and notifies the O&M Training Team Lead.

## 8.2 Orientation {#82-Orientation-765} 

Interns spend the first week completing required training coordinated by Learning and Development. Examples of training include but are not limited to: 

* The Chevron Way
* Tenets of Operation and Stop Work Authority
* Human Resources Policies
* Area Process Overview
* Compliance Training

## 8.3 Unit Assignment - Expectations and OTJ Training {#83-Unit-Assignment-Expectations-and-OTJ-Training-2065} 

The duration of an intern assignment is equivalent to one semester, or twelve to fourteen weeks. Throughout this period, operations interns will be assigned to a specific crew in a particular operating area. Interns shall display the same level of dedication and reliability that is expected of Chevron employees. All corporate and local policies are applicable to interns while working in the refinery. 

Interns are assigned to an operating area for the purpose of enhancing their knowledge of the manufacturing work environment. They are not to be considered as qualified operators or trainees. Their role in the work area should be limited to completion of a particular task under direct supervision of a job qualified operator, provided the intern has completed required training and on-the-job training associated with the task. Interns are prohibited from responding to emergencies. The [O & M Intern Program](https://pasweb.chevron.net/business-units/learning-development/o-m-intern-program) webpage provides more details including program guides detailing training and expectations.

## 8.4 Transition Process {#84-Transition-Process-2066} 

Interns may have an opportunity to transition to a full-time operator trainee. Interns must successfully complete the requirements in the Operations Internship Program Guide and there must be a business need for additional operator head count. An Intern transition must be approved by the Area Section Head in consultation with HR. If business needs dictate an extension to the internship or conversion to a full-time operator trainee, HR will communicate this opportunity with the Intern. 

Transition Process – Refer to the [O&M Internship Guide for Leaders](https://pasweb.chevron.net/business-units/learning-development/o-m-intern-program) for Chevron and Interns expectations, Team Leader Actions for hire/do not hire decisions and key reminders. In addition, the following applies: 

1.  Once an offer of intern extension or full-time employment is accepted, the intern can immediately begin formal training on their first operator job. All training requirements remain the same for job qualification.
2.  The 12-14 weeks Internship is counted toward employment time but does not count toward job training solo time.
3.  If internship was completed within 18 months of full-time hire date (OTS), an early promotion from OTS to OT1 may be granted on the condition below. However, the trainee remains on a 12-month probation from full-time hire date.
    1.  If the trainee has sufficiently retained knowledge of the internship and performance is progressing successfully, the promotion to OT1 can be granted 3 months after date of full-time hire.
    2.  If the trainee has not retained sufficient knowledge, or performance is not progressing successfully, the STL will provide such feedback to the trainee and reassess at the standard 6-month progression.
