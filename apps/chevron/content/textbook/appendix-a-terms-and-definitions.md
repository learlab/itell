## First-Half Terms {#First-Half-Terms-694t .sr-only} 

| ### **Term ** | ### **Definition** |
| --- | --- |
| Acceptable Entry Conditions | The conditions that must exist in a space to facilitate a worker’s safe entry into and work within a confined space. |
| Confined Space | A space that is:<br><br>1.  large enough and configured such that an employee can bodily enter and perform assigned work; and<br>2.  has limited or restricted means for entry or exit; and<br>3.  is not designed for continuous occupancy. |
| Confined Space Entry | The act of passing any part of a person’s body through the opening into a confined space where the point of entry is large enough to allow full bodily entry. Entry is considered to have occurred as soon as any part of the entrant’s body breaks the plane of an opening into that space. |
| CoW Documentation | Documents that are needed for work to proceed and that are accessible to all the affected personnel. Examples would include but are not limited to: work permits, hazard analysis, rescue plans, PPE matrix, etc. |
| Reclassified Confined Space | A Confined Space that was previously classified as a Permit-Required Confined Space, that no longer contains special hazardous characteristics. |
| Entry Log | A log that includes the name of the entrants and times they entered and exited the confined space. |

| ### **Term ** | ### **Definition** |
| --- | --- |
| Hazardous Atmosphere | An atmosphere that may expose workers to the risk of death, incapacitation, impairment of ability to self-rescue, injury or acute illness. |
| High-Level Approver | Person with the competency and authority to make a risk-based evaluation and determine whether proposed deviations from a CoW requirement and alternate controls adequately reduce risk and allow safe execution of work. BUs determine the appropriate organizational level of “high-level approvers” based upon the risk of the task, requirement, and/or deviation. |
| Inert Atmosphere | An atmosphere consisting primarily of an inert gas such as nitrogen or carbon dioxide that is effectively oxygen-free. |
| Non-Permit Required Confined Space | A Confined Space which does not contain special hazardous characteristics. |
| Permit-Required Confined Space / Hazardous Characteristics | A space that meets all the criteria of a Confined Space and has one or more of the following characteristics (equivalent to the OSHA definition of a permit-required confined space):<br><br>1.  Contains or has the potential to contain potentially hazardous atmosphere.<br>2.  Contains a material that has the potential for engulfing an entrant.<br>3.  Has an internal configuration such that an entrant could be trapped or asphyxiated by inwardly converging walls or by a floor that slopes downward and tapers to a smaller cross section; or<br>4.  Contains any other recognized serious potential safety or health hazard.<br><br>* A hazard defined as something that could cause harm or would interfere with the entrant’s ability to perform self-rescue. |
