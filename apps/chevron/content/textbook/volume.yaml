summary:
  Chevron's comprehensive training program ensures operators progress from new
  hires to Fully Qualified Operators (FQO) through a structured, multi-year
  process involving orientation, on-the-job training, and assessments. FQOs
  continue training for additional roles, with records meticulously maintained.
  Control Room Operators (CROs) and Head Operators (HOs) undergo specialized
  training, including console and simulator sessions, to maintain
  qualifications. Requalification processes address absences, ensuring operators
  remain current. Interns receive supervised exposure to operations, potentially
  transitioning to trainees. Unit School Instructors, selected for their
  expertise, facilitate training. The program emphasizes continuous learning and
  adaptation to procedural changes, documented via electronic systems to support
  operator competence and advancement.
