## 1 Operations Training Program Overview {#1-Operations-Training-Program-Overview-746 .sr-only} 

The operator training programs at Chevron’s Pascagoula Refinery encompass multi-year progression paths. The new hire trainee achieves fully qualified status as an operator by successfully completing the required training. These programs employ a building-block approach to learning to ensure the Refinery is provided with a well-qualified workforce. In addition, the trainee’s knowledge of and ability to safely and competently perform their job duties are evaluated throughout the program with written examinations, skill performance demonstrations, and verbal assessments.

## 1.1 Performance Expectations {#11-Performance-Expectations-2027} 

To be successful, an employee must:

* Take responsibility for his or her own learning by actively engaging in the learning process.
* Comply with company policies and guidelines.
* Complete any required pre-work before attending instructor-led classes either in person or online.
* Successfully complete training and assessment requirements per Table 2: GFOTP Corrective Action Guide and Table 4: Unit Job Training Corrective Action Guide.
* Complete training material on an acceptable timeline outlined in Tables 1, 6, and 7
* Achieve acceptable evaluations for performance and behavior. 

During the first twelve months of employment, all trainees are on probation. During this probationary period, the company can choose to terminate employment at any time.

## 1.2 L&D Classes Attendance Policy {#12-LandD-Classes-Attendance-Policy-747} 

While enrolled in a training program, employees will attend all scheduled training events. Personal appointments, vacations, and other supervisor approved off-time are expected to be taken outside of scheduled classes. If an employee misses a scheduled class due to an approved absence, the trainee’s supervisor is responsible for rescheduling training through Learning and Development.

## 1.3 Type of Competency Assessments {#13-Type-of-Competency-Assessments-2028} 

_Tests_

Written or electronic tests are used to assess trainee knowledge and cognitive skills in each area. Questions are linked to skill and knowledge requirements associated with the activity being assessed. Test question types that are commonly employed include multiple-choice, short answer, essay, and true/false. 

_Verbal Evaluation_

Verbal evaluations are conducted by a team of individuals as outlined in the appropriate section of this manual. In both instances, the trainee is expected to orally recall, explain, and/or defend his or her response to the Interview Team. The Interview Team, in return, will provide the trainee with feedback to close any learning gaps.

_Skill Assessments_

Skill assessments measure the skills required to complete a task through the visual observation of the trainee, including field assessments, field tests, and skill validation assessments. These are conducted as part of the formal training process and on a continuing basis as part of the Refinery’s compliance training program

## 1.4 Performance Evaluations {#14-Performance-Evaluations-2029} 

Supervisor performance evaluations are completed in addition to the defined competency evaluations and are required at the following intervals:

* 6 months of service (KR109 form)
* 1 year of service, or completion of first job qualification, whichever comes first (GO310 form)
* 2 years of service, or completion of second job qualification, whichever comes first (GO310 form)
* 3 years of service, or completion of fourth job qualification, whichever comes first (GO310 form)

The STL ensures evaluations accurately document the trainees’ performance and are completed prior to the trainees’ advancements. The STL will send an electronic copy of the completed evaluation to HR for inclusion in the employee’s files. O&M Training Team Leader will send the trainee’s STL a reminder at least one month prior to the trainee’s service anniversary to ensure the performance evaluation is completed. Evaluations beyond the 3rd year service anniversary are managed by Operations Leadership and Human Resources.

## 1.5 Board of Review (BOR) {#15-Board-of-Review-BOR-2030} 

A BOR is convened to either determine an appropriate training plan for job requalification or address training progress or competency of an employee whose test grades or performance do not meet minimum requirements. Typical BOR recommendations include re-testing, additional training, Performance Improvement plan for employees who are beyond the 12-month probationary period, or termination.

BOR members consist of Area Section Head, Shift Team Leader, O&M Training Team Leader, Operations HRBP (optional for requalification), and the Unit Field Trainer (optional for addressing training progress / competency).

## 1.6 Training Records {#16-Training-Records-2031} 

Electronic Records

Electronic records are recorded in the Learning Management System (LMS). 

Hard-Copy Records

L&D maintains files of job qualification training documentation for operator trainees during progression through the formal training program. Upon reaching Fully Qualified Operator status, files are forwarded to Central Records for storage and retention.

## 1.7 Training Program Evaluation {#17-Training-Program-Evaluation-2032} 

Four levels of evaluation are applied in measuring the effectiveness of O&M training programs. Definitions with examples are: 

* Level 1 Reaction: students provide L&D with immediate feedback through feedback forms, group discussions, online assessments.
* Level 2 Learning: evaluation of what was learned through knowledge quizzes, pre and post training assessments, skill assessments
* Level 3 Knowledge Transfer: Trainers observe participants in work settings to assess whether they are utilizing the knowledge and skills acquired during training in their daily tasks. O&M Leadership provides feedback through trainee performance evaluations.
* Level 4 Results: Measure of training program effectiveness as indicated by the impact on the business, for example measuring the number of incidents with root cause of training.

The FOTP Coordinator and Console Training Specialist will review the training programs periodically to ensure accuracy and best practice is maintained. BORs and incident investigations may highlight training gaps and be used for continuous improvement of the training program. Requests made by stakeholders to modify program delivery or content are made utilizing KR-235, FOTP Curriculum Change Request Form.
