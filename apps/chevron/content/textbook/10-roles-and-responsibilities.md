- question: What steps are involved in progressing from a trainee to a Fully Qualified Operator (FQO) in the Pascagoula Refinery's Formal Operator Training Program?
  answer: |+
    Progression from a trainee to a Fully Qualified Operator (FQO) involves completing the Global Formal Operator Training Program (GFOTP), which includes orientation, classroom instruction, and on-the-job training (OTJ). Trainees must complete competency assessments such as written exams, skill assessments, and verbal evaluations, along with field tests and situation problems. They must also work through the Break-in Guide, qualify on multiple jobs, and pass the Qualification Review Board (QRB) evaluations. Performance evaluations are conducted periodically, and pay progression occurs based on the successful completion of these milestones.
