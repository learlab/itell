Introduction
------------

The Confined Space Entry standard is designed to help prevent illnes and injuries to personnel, damage to property or adverse environmental impact when personnel are performing work in confined spaces. Confined Spaces are defined as spaces large enough and so configured that personnel can bodily enter and perform assigned work, have limited or restricted means for entry or exit and are not designed for continuous occupancy. This standard defines the requirements for Confined Space Entry

## Requirements {#Requirements-164pt} 

The following sections provide minimum requirements for Confined Space Entry as well as supporting guidance to clarify the intent of those requirements.

* Requirements of this Standard **shall** be met.
* Guidance in this Standard **may** be used as an aid to develop local documents that meet or exceed Control of Work (CoW) requirements. If examples are provided within guidance sections, they are not meant to represent the only acceptable means for meeting a requirement. BUs may develop or utilize other suitable methods not discussed in this document as long as the requirements are met. Implementation of guidance is not auditable.

## Requirement 1 {#Requirement-1-686t .sr-only} 

### Requirement 1 {#requirement-1}

Controls shall be in place to prevent unauthorized entry into confined spaces.

* Openings large enough to allow a person to enter a permit-required confined space and is readily accessible under normal conditions, shall be visibly identified as a confided space when the attendant is not present. (e.g., signage or other effective means of communication)

## Requirement 2 - 4 {#Requirement-2-4-687t .sr-only} 

### Requirement 2 {#requirement-2}

BUs shall identify and evaluate their confined spaces to determine those that are permit-required confined spaces.

* Entries into Confined Spaces with Hazardous Characteristics shall require a Confined Space Entry Permit

### Requirement 3 {#requirement-3}

A Hazard Analysis shall be conducted in accordance with the Hazard Analysis OE Standard when planning work involving Confined Space Entry.

### Requirement 4 {#requirement-4}

The Hazard Analysis and/or CoW documentation shall address the following elements:

1.  Identification of significant potential hazards from task, space, and simultaneous operations (SIMOPS) in area. 
2.  Internal configuration, obstructions, or unique hazards associated with the space (e.g., fall hazards, residues, and contaminants, etc.). 
3.  Acceptable entry conditions (e.g., oxygen concentration, %LEL, toxics). 
4.   Appropriate air ventilation (e.g., continuous forced, local exhaust, etc.). 
5.  Verification of acceptable entry conditions for duration of entry (e.g., acceptable gas testing frequency). 
6.   Positive Physical Isolation of hazardous energy in accordance with Isolation of Hazardous Energy OE Standard. 
7.   Equipment appropriately rated for the space to be used (e.g., electrical equipment rated for the area classification) and mitigating controls for such equipment as necessary (e.g., Hot Work permit). 
8.  Specialized equipment (e.g., respiratory equipment, rescue equipment, ingress and egress equipment, etc.). 
9.  Personal protective equipment (PPE) requirements.
10. Heat stress safeguards (e.g., work/rest breaks, specialty PPE) as necessary.

## Requirements 5-7 {#Requirements-5-7-688t .sr-only} 

### Requirement 5 {#requirement-5}

Permit Required Work Authorization shall be required for entry into Permit-Required Confined Spaces.

* BUs shall determine the level of Work Authorization required for entry into Non-Permit Required Confined Spaces and/or Reclassified Confined Spaces.

### Requirement 6 {#requirement-6}

Gas testing shall be required prior to Confined Space Entry in accordance with the Portable Gas Detection OE Standard.

* Authorized entrants and/or their representatives shall have the right to observe any gas monitoring/testing of Confined Spaces.
* If gas testing indicates changed conditions, work must stop, employees must evacuate the space and the space must be re-evaluated to address the changed conditions before work may resume.

### Requirement 7 {#requirement-7}

Additional controls shall be in place when work is performed in Permit-Required Confined Spaces including:

1.  A rescue team and appropriate rescue equipment 
2.  Attendant
3.  Entry Supervisor 
4.  Appropriate air ventilation 
5.  Isolation of hazardous energy in accordance with the Isolation of Hazardous Energy OE Standard
6.  Entry log maintained

## Requirements 8 {#Requirements-8-690t .sr-only} 

### Requirement 8 {#requirement-8}

Rescue plans shall be developed for Permit-Required Confined Space Entry. At a minimum, the rescue plans shall include the following: 

1.  Rescue methods to be used in the following order of preference: 
    * Self-rescue
    * Non-entry rescue using retrieval device
    * Entry rescue
2.  Non-entry retrieval systems shall be utilized by authorized entrants (e.g., chest or full body harness with a retrieval line or wristlets). 
    * If the system increases the overall risk of the entry, or does not increase the safety of the task, it is acceptable to waive the requirement. 
    * The BU shall have a process for evaluating and approving this exception. 
3.  Means of communicating the need for rescue. 
4.  Requirements that rescue personnel are trained, properly equipped, and follow established procedures specific to the potential hazards of the Confined Space. 
5.  Availability of at least one member of the rescue team or service who is trained and competent in basic first aid and CPR. 
6.  Ability of rescuer to reach the victim(s) within a time frame that is appropriate for the permit space hazard(s) identified. 
7.  Provide the rescue personnel access to the space from which rescue may be necessary. 
8.  Availability of mechanical devices to retrieve personnel from vertical spaces more than 5 feet (1.52 m) deep. 
9.  Method to verify the competency of rescue personnel.

## Requirements 9-10 {#Requirements-9-10-689t .sr-only} 

### Requirement 9 {#requirement-9}

The following shall be met to reclassify a Permit-Required Confined Space.

1.  The characteristics that made the space a permit required confined space shall be eliminated.
2.  Work conducted within the confined space shall not create a hazardous atmosphere or condition.
3.  Affected personnel shall be notified that the space has been reclassified.
4.  Documentation, including updated hazard analysis, authorizing the space to be reclassified shall be approved.

If special hazardous characteristics arise in a reclassified confined space, all authorized entrants shall exit the confined space, and the space shall be reevaluated to determine how it will be classified.

Entry into inert atmosphere confined spaces shall only be allowed after alterative options have been evaluated and entry has documented approval by a High-Level Approver.

* BUs shall develop specific inert entry procedures and controls that shall be implemented and followed.
* Specialized rescue plans shall be developed and followed.

Inert atmospheres require specialty sensors, especially lower explosive limit (LEL) including infrared sensors or dilution tubes shall be used.
