## 3 Fully Qualified Operator (FQO) Training {#3-Fully-Qualified-Operator-FQO-Training-742 .sr-only} 

**Any deviation to program content or required times must be approved by the business unit Area Section Head and documented on a KR-988, Training Program Waiver form. This waiver is used for extenuating circumstances and requests are considered by the Area Section Head on a case-by-case basis.**

## 3.1 Job Training & Transfer Training {#31-Job-Training-and-Transfer-Training-2023} 

Fully Qualified Operators must continue training in each of their areas’ remaining job roles. FQO Job qualification training is designed to provide continuing training for an operator to assume duties of additional operator jobs, either within their current Business Unit or when re-assigned to another Business Unit. If a business unit has more than 4 jobs, it is an expectation the FQO will continue job training at the direction of their supervisor. 

Fully qualified operators must complete the requirements listed below, and work the job solo a minimum of 504 hours, or 42 12-hour shifts. After completing unit school and shadow training, FQOs are expected to complete job training material and become job qualified on an acceptable timeline outlined below:

| **FQO: General time expectations for completing training requirements** |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Field jobs** | 1st Month | 2nd Month | 3rd Month | 4th Month | 5th Month | 6th Month |
| **Completion Goal** | Break-in Guide<br><br>STL SA<br><br>3 Sit Prob | 6 Sit Prob | 9 Sit Prob | 12 Sit Prob | 15 Sit Prob | Qual CL |
| **FQO: Maximum time expectation for completing job training requirements and qualifying is 12 months.** |     |     |     |     |     |     |

Table 6: FQO Field Job Training Timeline

Field Tests, FQE, and the QRB are not required for FQO job training as the employees’ experience and competency level in general operation of process and equipment has been established. 

Upon successful completion, the UFT forwards the completed training package to the LMS Specialist in L&D.  The LMS Specialist records the qualification in the LMS and forwards the files to Central Records.

## 3.2 Maintaining Qualification {#32-Maintaining-Qualification-743} 

To maintain qualification, the Fully Qualified Operator must work a minimum of one 12-hour shift in the job in any 6-month period.

## 3.3 Refresher Training {#33-Refresher-Training-2024} 

_Refresher Examinations_

Refresher examinations are required every three years and are designed to demonstrate the operator’s knowledge of a specific job. Each job has a refresher examination comprised between 25 and 40 questions. Each operator must complete a refresher exam for each job on which he or she is qualified. A passing score of 80% must be achieved. Unsuccessful attempts are managed by the area business unit.
