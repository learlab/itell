1\. The top-side navigation bar shows your current progress (Page and Chunk headers).

2 The left hand navigation bar will have links to different Chapters and Pages within the Module. Pages with checkmarks mean that you have completed those pages. Pages with locks mean that you have to complete the preceding page to unlock those pages.

3\. Click on the "Assignment" link to move to the bottom of the page where the Summary-writing activity is located.

4\. Click on the "Reset" button to reset the progress for the page.

5\. Click on the "Back to top" link to move to the top of the page.

### Making Progress

Most iTELL pages will have one more short answer questions and a single summary writing activity at the end of the page. You will not be able to proceed to the next page without successfully completing all tasks on your current page.

#### Read

Most of the content in a page will be blurred at the beginning. As you read through the page, click on the red button that reads "Continue reading" to _unblur_ the next section and continue reading.

<i-image

Unblur the next section by clicking on the red button when you are ready to continue.

</i-image>

#### Answer Questions

Sometimes you will see a Constructed Response Item instead of the Continue Reading button. After clicking the button, you will provide a brief explanation of a concept to demonstrate your understanding of the text that you have read.

<i-image

If you submit an incorrect answer, iTELL AI will provide support to help you revise your answer

#### Complete the Passage

A Fill-in-the-Blank activity is located at the bottom of some pages. After you answer all short answer questions on the current page, you will be asked to solve each sentence about the passage. In order to see the number of letters in each answer, hover over the corresponding blank. Toggle "Hide Hints" to turn this feature off. When you finish filling each blank, press "Check Answers" to see your results. If you'd like to try again, please press "Try Again" and repeat this process.

#### Write a Summary

A summary writing activity is located at the bottom of some pages. After you answer all short answer questions on the current page, you will be asked to summarize the contents of the page before you can move on to the next page. Write a summary and submit it to receive feedback.

![summ.png](https://pxeblicvfnzlnounkznu.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/strapi/files/summ.png-4c29282ba7012795160e650188da5001.png)

### Evaluation

Your summary will be evaluated according to four metrics:

**Content**: Whether your summary shows good coverage of the page's main points and provides details to support those points.

**Language Borrowing**: Whether you have written the summary in your own words or borrowed language from the text.

**Relevance**: Whether the topics and ideas discussed in your summary are sufficiently relevant to the content of the page.

### Feedback

If your summary fails to pass the evaluation, you will be given additional attempts to revise and resubmit your summary. Click on the \_Details\_ tab to access more detailed feedback to help you write a better summary. Your new summary must be significantly distinct from your previous summary. The \_Uniqueness\_ bar will visualize the difference between your previous summary and your current summary.

  alt="summfeedback.png"
  width="1887"
  height="1016">

iTELL will evaluate your summary and provide a revision

</i-image>

### Re-reading

If your summary fails to pass the evaluation, iTELL's conversational agent (iTELL AI) will analyze your summary and redirect you to a section of the page. You will then re-read this section, discuss it with iTELL AI, and finally return to revise your summary.

### Rewards

With consistent performance, you can earn opportunities to advance more quickly through the text.

**Streaks**: When you write multiple passing summaries or answer several questions correctly in a row, you build an achievement streak. Maintaining these streaks can earn you the option to skip certain writing summaries or answering questions.

<i-image
  style="aspect-ratio:1887/987;"
  src="https://pxeblicvfnzlnounkznu.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/strapi/files/streakdis.png-6d5fb605475671ae6b21f6e5ea52fb49.png"
  alt="streakdis.png"
  width="1887"
  height="987">

Visual cues like the flame icon on the question box will show that you are currently on a streak

</i-image>

**Exceptional Work**: If you write a particularly thorough and insightful summary that exceeds the evaluation criteria, you may be given the opportunity to skip writing a summary.

These advancement opportunities help ensure you're spending time on material that challenges you while allowing you to progress more quickly through concepts you've already mastered.

### Notes

Your past summaries will be accessible from your dashboard.
