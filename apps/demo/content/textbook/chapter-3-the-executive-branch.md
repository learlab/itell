## The Executive Branch {#The-Executive-Branch-4752} 

<i-callout>

In this chapter, you will learn about:

* The Executive Branch
* The President of the United States
* The agencies in the federal government

</i-callout>

The Executive Branch is one branch or part of the U.S. government. The President of the United States is in charge of the Executive Branch.

The other parts of the Executive Branch are the President’s Cabinet, the Vice President of the United States, and the Executive Departments and agencies in the federal government. 

During the Constitutional Convention, the Founders were afraid that if the President had too much power, then the President would be above the law and could become a king or queen. The Founders believed that in the United States no one is above the law. This is called the “rule of law”. The Founders believed that the President should have the power to protect and serve the people of the United States. They also believed that the President should follow the rule of law.

## The President's Cabinet {#The-Presidents-Cabinet-4753} 

The Executive Branch includes the Executive Departments and agencies that are part of the federal government. The Executive Departments and agencies help the President to enforce laws, protect the country, work with other countries, and provide services to the people of the United States.

The people who lead the Executive Departments are mostly called Secretaries. For example, the person who leads the Department of Homeland Security is called the Secretary of Homeland Security.

The leaders of the Executive Departments are also called Cabinet-level positions because the people who lead each agency are part of the President’s Cabinet. A “cabinet” is another word for a “group of advisors.” The President’s Cabinet advises the President. The President can also choose to have other people from the federal government serve on the Cabinet. 

Each Executive Department has many smaller agencies. For example, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is part of the Department of Justice. Another example is U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). USCIS is part of the Department of Homeland Security.

## The Commander in Chief {#The-Commander-in-Chief-4754} 

The President of the United States is the Commander in Chief of the military. This means that the President is in charge of everyone serving in U.S. military. Another term for the U.S. military is the U.S. Armed Forces.

In the United States, serving in the U.S. Armed Forces is voluntary. Today there are over 2 million people serving in the U.S. Armed Forces. For more information about the U.S. Armed Forces, please visit: U.S. Department of Defense at [www.defense.gov.](https://www.defense.gov)

## Voting for President {#Voting-for-President-4755} 

U.S. citizens vote for President in November, and the President is elected for four years. A person can only be elected to be President two times. This means a person can get elected for four years, and then get reelected for four more years.

The Constitution says that in order to get elected President, a person must be 35 years old or older and was a U.S. citizen at birth.

When a person runs for President of the United States they are nominated by a political party. Today, there are two major political parties in the United States. One party is called the Democratic Party, and the other party is called the Republican Party.

## The Vice President {#The-Vice-President-4756} 

The Vice President of the United States works for the President in the Executive Branch. The Vice President is an advisor to the President, and a member of the President’s Cabinet. 

Under the Constitution, the role of the Vice President is very important. The Constitution says that if the President can no longer serve, then the Vice President becomes President. There have been some Presidents who have not served all four years of their term. For example, there are Presidents who died while serving in office. When this has happened, the Vice President becomes the President.

If both the President and the Vice President can no longer serve, then the Speaker of the House of Representatives becomes President.
