summary: |

  The text explores the science of psychology, emphasizing various methods of acquiring knowledge, including the scientific method, which is crucial for empirical research. 

  Psychology is established as a science similar to other natural sciences, utilizing systematic empiricism, empirical questions, and public knowledge to differentiate itself from pseudoscience. 

  The goals of psychology—describing, predicting, and explaining phenomena—are achieved through rigorous observation and research. Despite common reliance on intuition, scientific research often contradicts folk psychology. Experimental and clinical psychologists advance understanding through empirical studies, underscoring the importance of a scientific approach in practice. 

  The scientific process involves generating testable hypotheses, designing studies, and conducting analyses to draw conclusions. Ethical considerations are paramount, guided by historical frameworks and codes ensuring participant protection and research integrity. 

  Psychological measurement involves reliability and validity to ensure meaningful data interpretation, with strategies to minimize bias and enhance the research's impact.
