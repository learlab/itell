## Control of Extraneous Variables {#Control-of-Extraneous-Variables-4536} 

As we have seen previously in the chapter, an extraneous variable is anything that varies in the context of a study other than the independent and dependent variables. In an experiment on the effect of expressive writing on health, for example, extraneous variables would include participant variables (individual differences) such as their writing ability, their diet, and their gender. They would also include situational or task variables such as the time of day when participants write, whether they write by hand or on a computer, and the weather. Extraneous variables pose a problem because many of them are likely to have some effect on the dependent variable. For example, participants’ health will be affected by many things other than whether or not they engage in expressive writing. This influencing factor can make it difficult to separate the effect of the independent variable from the effects of the extraneous variables, which is why it is important to control extraneous variables by holding them constant.

## Extraneous Variables as Noise {#Extraneous-Variables-as-Noise-4537} 

Extraneous variables make it difficult to detect the effect of the independent variable in two ways. One is by adding variability or “noise” to the data. Imagine a simple experiment on the effect of mood (happy vs. sad) on the number of happy childhood events people are able to recall. Participants are put into a negative or positive mood (by showing them a happy or sad video clip) and then asked to recall as many happy childhood events as they can. The two leftmost columns of Table 5.1 show what the data might look like if there were no extraneous variables and the number of happy childhood events participants recalled was affected only by their moods. Every participant in the happy mood condition recalled exactly four happy childhood events, and every participant in the sad mood condition recalled exactly three. The effect of mood here is quite obvious. In reality, however, the data would probably look more like those in the two rightmost columns of Table 5.1. Even in the happy mood condition, some participants would recall fewer happy memories because they have fewer to draw on, use less effective recall strategies, or are less motivated. And even in the sad mood condition, some participants would recall more happy childhood memories because they have more happy memories to draw on, they use more effective recall strategies, or they are more motivated. Although the mean difference between the two groups is the same as in the idealized data, this difference is much less obvious in the context of the greater variability in the data. Thus one reason researchers try to control extraneous variables is so their data look more like the idealized data in Table 5.1, which makes the effect of the independent variable easier to detect (although real data never look quite _that_ good).

## Holding Variables Constant {#Holding-Variables-Constant-4538 .sr-only} 

One way to control extraneous variables is to hold them constant. This technique can mean holding situation or task variables constant by testing all participants in the same location, giving them identical instructions, treating them in the same way, and so on. It can also mean holding participant variables constant. For example, many studies of language limit participants to right-handed people, who generally have their language areas isolated in their left cerebral hemispheres\[1\]. Left-handed people are more likely to have their language areas isolated in their right cerebral hemispheres or distributed across both hemispheres, which can change the way they process language and thereby add noise to the data. 

In principle, researchers can control extraneous variables by limiting participants to one very specific category of person, such as 20-year-old, heterosexual, female, right-handed psychology majors. The obvious downside to this approach is that it would lower the external validity of the study—in particular, the extent to which the results can be generalized beyond the people actually studied. For example, it might be unclear whether results obtained with a sample of younger lesbian women would apply to older gay men. In many situations, the advantages of a diverse sample (increased external validity) outweigh the reduction in noise achieved by a homogeneous one.

## Extraneous Variables as Confounding Variables {#Extraneous-Variables-as-Confounding-Variables-4539} 

The second way that extraneous variables can make it difficult to detect the effect of the independent variable is by becoming confounding variables. A [**confounding variable**](https://kpu.pressbooks.pub/psychmethods4e/chapter/experiment-basics/#term_61_1007) is an extraneous variable that differs on average _across_ levels of the independent variable (i.e., it is an extraneous variable that varies systematically with the independent variable). For example, in almost all experiments, participants’ age will be an extraneous variable, with some participants older and some younger. But as long as there are younger and older participants in each condition so that the average age is roughly equal across the conditions, then this variation is probably acceptable (and may even be desirable). What would be bad, however, would be for participants in one condition to be substantially younger on average and participants in another condition to be substantially older on average. In this case, age would be a confounding variable. 

To confound means to confuse, and this effect is exactly why confounding variables are undesirable. Because they differ systematically across conditions—just like the independent variable—they provide an alternative explanation for any observed difference in the dependent variable. One way to avoid confounding variables is by holding extraneous variables constant. For example, one could prevent age from becoming a confounding variable by limiting participants only to 21-year-olds. But this approach is not always desirable for reasons we have already discussed. A second and much more general approach—random assignment to conditions—will be discussed in detail shortly.

## Treatment and Control Conditions {#Treatment-and-Control-Conditions-4540} 

In applied psychological research, a [**treatment**](https://kpu.pressbooks.pub/psychmethods4e/chapter/experiment-basics/#term_61_1008) is any intervention meant to change people’s behavior for the better. This intervention includes psychotherapies and medical treatments for psychological disorders but also interventions designed to improve learning, promote conservation, reduce prejudice, and so on. To determine whether a treatment works, participants are randomly assigned to either a [**treatment condition**](https://kpu.pressbooks.pub/psychmethods4e/chapter/experiment-basics/#term_61_1009), in which they receive the treatment, or a [**control condition**](https://kpu.pressbooks.pub/psychmethods4e/chapter/experiment-basics/#term_61_1010), in which they do not receive the treatment. If participants in the treatment condition end up better off than participants in the control condition—for example, they are less depressed, learn faster, conserve more, express less prejudice—then the researcher can conclude that the treatment works. In research on the effectiveness of psychotherapies and medical treatments, this type of experiment is often called a [**randomized clinical trial**](https://kpu.pressbooks.pub/psychmethods4e/chapter/experiment-basics/#term_61_1011). 

There are different types of control conditions. In a [**no-treatment control condition**](https://kpu.pressbooks.pub/psychmethods4e/chapter/experiment-basics/#term_61_1014), participants receive no treatment whatsoever. One problem with this approach, however, is the existence of placebo effects. A [**placebo**](https://kpu.pressbooks.pub/psychmethods4e/chapter/experiment-basics/#term_61_1015) is a simulated treatment that lacks any active ingredient or element that should make it effective, and a [**placebo effect**](https://kpu.pressbooks.pub/psychmethods4e/chapter/experiment-basics/#term_61_1016) is a positive effect of such a treatment. Many folk remedies that seem to work—such as eating chicken soup for a cold or placing soap under the bed sheets to stop nighttime leg cramps—are probably nothing more than placebos. Although placebo effects are not well understood, they are probably driven primarily by people’s expectations that they will improve. Having the expectation to improve can result in reduced stress, anxiety, and depression, which can alter perceptions and even improve immune system functioning (Price, Finniss, & Benedetti, 2008)[\[2\]](https://kpu.pressbooks.pub/psychmethods4e/chapter/experiment-basics/#footnote-61-2).

Placebo effects are interesting in their own right (see Note “The Powerful Placebo”), but they also pose a serious problem for researchers who want to determine whether a treatment works. Figure 5.2 shows some hypothetical results in which participants in a treatment condition improved more on average than participants in a no-treatment control condition. If these conditions (the two leftmost bars in Figure 5.2) were the only conditions in this experiment, however, one could not conclude that the treatment worked. It could be instead that participants in the treatment group improved more because they expected to improve, while those in the no-treatment control condition did not.

[![Figure 5.2 Hypothetical Results From a Study Including Treatment, No-Treatment, and Placebo Conditions](https://kpu.pressbooks.pub/app/uploads/sites/38/2021/12/5.2-300x145.png)](https://kpu.pressbooks.pub/app/uploads/sites/38/2021/12/5.2-300x145.png)_Figure 5.2 Hypothetical Results From a Study Including Treatment, No-Treatment, and Placebo Conditions_

Fortunately, there are several solutions to this problem. One is to include a [**placebo control condition**](https://kpu.pressbooks.pub/psychmethods4e/chapter/experiment-basics/#term_61_1017), in which participants receive a placebo that looks much like the treatment but lacks the active ingredient or element thought to be responsible for the treatment’s effectiveness. When participants in a treatment condition take a pill, for example, then those in a placebo control condition would take an identical-looking pill that lacks the active ingredient in the treatment (a “sugar pill”). In research on psychotherapy effectiveness, the placebo might involve going to a psychotherapist and talking in an unstructured way about one’s problems. The idea is that if participants in both the treatment and the placebo control groups expect to improve, then any improvement in the treatment group over and above that in the placebo control group must have been caused by the treatment and not by participants’ expectations.

## Wait-List Controls {#Wait-List-Controls-4541} 

Of course, the principle of informed consent requires that participants be told that they will be assigned to either a treatment or a placebo control condition—even though they cannot be told which until the experiment ends. In many cases the participants who had been in the control condition are then offered an opportunity to have the real treatment. An alternative approach is to use a [**wait-list control condition**](https://kpu.pressbooks.pub/psychmethods4e/chapter/experiment-basics/#term_61_1018), in which participants are told that they will receive the treatment but must wait until the participants in the treatment condition have already received it. This disclosure allows researchers to compare participants who have received the treatment with participants who are not currently receiving it but who still expect to improve (eventually). A final solution to the problem of placebo effects is to leave out the control condition completely and compare any new treatment with the best available alternative treatment. For example, a new treatment for simple phobia could be compared with standard exposure therapy. Because participants in both conditions receive a treatment, their expectations about improvement should be similar. This approach also makes sense because once there is an effective treatment, the interesting question about a new treatment is not simply “Does it work?” but “Does it work better than what is already available?
