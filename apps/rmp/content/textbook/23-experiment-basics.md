## Learning Objectives {#Learning-Objectives-2001 .sr-only} 

<i-callout variant="info" title="Learning Objectives">

1\. Explain what an experiment is and recognize examples of studies that are experiments and studies that are not experiments.

2\. Distinguish between the manipulation of the independent variable and control of extraneous variables and explain the importance of each.

## What Is an Experiment? {#What-Is-an-Experiment?-4474} 

As we saw earlier in the book, an experiment is a type of study designed specifically to answer the question of whether there is a causal relationship between two variables. In other words, whether changes in one variable (referred to as an independent variable) cause a change in another variable (referred to as a dependent variable). 

Experiments have two fundamental features. The first is that the researchers manipulate, or systematically vary, the level of the independent variable. The different levels of the independent variable are called conditions. For example, in Darley and Latané’s experiment, the independent variable was the number of witnesses that participants believed to be present. The researchers manipulated this independent variable by telling participants that there were either one, two, or five other students involved in the discussion, thereby creating three conditions. For a new researcher, it is easy to confuse these terms by believing there are three independent variables in this situation: one, two, or five students involved in the discussion, but there is actually only one independent variable (number of witnesses) with three different levels or conditions (one, two or five students).

## Control of Extraneous Variables {#Control-of-Extraneous-Variables-4475 .sr-only} 

The second fundamental feature of an experiment is that the researcher exerts [**control**](https://kpu.pressbooks.pub/psychmethods4e/chapter/experiment-basics/#term_61_1006) over, or minimizes the variability in, variables other than the independent and dependent variable. These other variables are called [**extraneous variables**](https://kpu.pressbooks.pub/psychmethods4e/chapter/experiment-basics/#term_61_901). Darley and Latané tested all their participants in the same room, exposed them to the same emergency situation, and so on. They also randomly assigned their participants to conditions so that the three groups would be similar to each other to begin with. Notice that although the words manipulation and control have similar meanings in everyday language, researchers make a clear distinction between them. They manipulate the independent variable by systematically changing its levels and control other variables by holding them constant.

## Manipulation of the Independent Variable {#Manipulation-of-the-Independent-Variable-4476} 

Again, to [**manipulate**](https://kpu.pressbooks.pub/psychmethods4e/chapter/experiment-basics/#term_61_1001) an independent variable means to change its level systematically so that different groups of participants are exposed to different levels of that variable, or the same group of participants is exposed to different levels at different times. For example, to see whether expressive writing affects people’s health, a researcher might instruct some participants to write about traumatic experiences and others to write about neutral experiences. The different levels of the independent variable are referred to as conditions, and researchers often give the conditions short descriptive names to make it easy to talk and write about them. In this case, the conditions might be called the “traumatic condition” and the “neutral condition.”

Notice that the manipulation of an independent variable must involve the active intervention of the researcher. Comparing groups of people who differ on the independent variable before the study begins is not the same as manipulating that variable. For example, a researcher who compares the health of people who already keep a journal with the health of people who do not keep a journal has not manipulated this variable and therefore has not conducted an experiment. This distinction is important because groups that already differ in one way at the beginning of a study are likely to differ in other ways too. For example, people who choose to keep journals might also be more conscientious, more introverted, or less stressed than people who do not. Therefore, any observed difference between the two groups in terms of their health might have been caused by whether or not they keep a journal, or it might have been caused by any of the other differences between people who do and do not keep journals. Thus the active manipulation of the independent variable is crucial for eliminating potential alternative explanations for the results.

## Caveat: ethics {#Caveat-ethics-2004 .sr-only} 

Of course, there are many situations in which the independent variable cannot be manipulated for practical or ethical reasons and therefore an experiment is not possible. For example, whether or not people have a significant early illness experience cannot be manipulated, making it impossible to conduct an experiment on the effect of early illness experiences on the development of hypochondriasis. This caveat does not mean it is impossible to study the relationship between early illness experiences and hypochondriasis—only that it must be done using nonexperimental approaches. We will discuss this type of methodology in detail later in the book.

## Multi-level designs {#Multi-level-designs-4477 .sr-only} 

Independent variables can be manipulated to create two conditions and experiments involving a single independent variable with two conditions are often referred to as a [**single factor two-level design**](https://kpu.pressbooks.pub/psychmethods4e/chapter/experiment-basics/#term_61_1002). However, sometimes greater insights can be gained by adding more conditions to an experiment. When an experiment has one independent variable that is manipulated to produce more than two conditions it is referred to as a [**single factor multi level design**](https://kpu.pressbooks.pub/psychmethods4e/chapter/experiment-basics/#term_61_1003)**.**  So rather than comparing a condition in which there was one witness to a condition in which there were five witnesses (which would represent a single-factor two-level design), Darley and Latané’s experiment used a single factor multi-level design, by manipulating the independent variable to produce three conditions (a one witness, a two witnesses, and a five witnesses condition).
