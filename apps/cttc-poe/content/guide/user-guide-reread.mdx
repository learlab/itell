### Overview

#### Introduction

This document provides guidelines for using Intelligent Text for Enhanced Lifelong Learning (iTELL) for users. We cover the iTELL adaptation of Principles of Macroeconomics. The textbook was redesigned into an interactive web version by a team comprising a subject matter expert, a content and assessment developer, a multimedia and web developer, and an instructional designer from Georgia Tech.

#### Acknowledgements

We would like to thank [the authors and contributors of the original textbook](https://openstax.org/books/principles-macroeconomics-2e/pages/preface). We also appreciate Affordable Learning Georgia, the National Science Foundation, and The National AI Institute for Adult Learning and Online Education (AI-ALOE) for providing funds to support this project.

### 1. Getting Started

#### Surveys

### 2. Making Progress in iTELL

#### Pages

The textbook's contents are divided into Pages. You can access different Pages using the left-side navigation bar.

Below is an overview of what a Page in an iTELL book looks like.

<Image src="/images/userguide/userguide_prolific_2_reread.png">
  What each Page looks like.
</Image>

(<span style= {{ color: 'red' }}>**1**</span>) The progress bar (in (<span style= {{ color: '#60a5fa' }}>**blue**</span>)) shows how far you have scrolled down the page.
(<span style= {{ color: 'red' }}>**2**</span>) The left-side navigation bar will have links to different Chapters and Sections within the Module. Pages with checkmarks mean that you have completed those pages. Pages with locks mean that you have to complete the preceding page to unlock those pages.
(<span style= {{ color: 'red' }}>**3**</span>) If you get stuck at any point, click on this **Reset page** button to restart your progress for the page.
(<span style= {{ color: 'red' }}>**4**</span>) Click on this quick link to move to the bottom of the page where the Summary-writing textbox is located.
(<span style= {{ color: 'red' }}>**5**</span>) Click on this quick link to move to the top of the page.
(<span style= {{ color: 'red' }}>**6**</span>) The right-side navigation bar will have quick links to different subsections within the page.

#### Making Progress

In most Pages, you will be asked to **1)** answer constructed response items and **2)** write a summary. You will not be able to proceed to the next page without successfully completing all tasks on your current page.

##### 1) Read

Most of the contents in a page will be blurred at the beginning. As you read through the page, click on the red button (**1**) that reads "Click here to continue reading" to _unblur_ the next section (**2**) and continue reading.

<Image src="/images/userguide/userguide_read.png">

</Image>

##### 2) Answer Constructed Response Items

Some parts of the text will have constructed response items instead of the "Click here to continue reading" button. These items are short written questions where you provide a brief explanation of a concept to demonstrate your understanding of the text that you have read.

<Image src="/images/userguide/userguide_prolific_3_reread.png">
  You will need to answer the constructed response item first to unblur the next section
</Image>

<Image src="/images/userguide/userguide_prolific_4_reread.png">
  Submitting an answer to the constructed response item will unlock the next section
</Image>

##### 3) Write a Summary

A summary text box is located at the bottom of each page. After you answer all constructed response items on your current page, you will be asked to summarize the contents of the page before you can move on to the next Section. Write a summary and submit it to have it evaluated by the AI tutor.

<Image src="/images/userguide/userguide_summary.png">
  The summary feature is disabled until you finish reading the whole page and answer all constructed response items on the page.
</Image>

_> What makes a successful summary_

A successful summary will…

- Be within 50 ~ 200 words long
- Be written in English
- Be on topic
- Not be plagiarized
- Use appropriate language

_> Re-reading_

After submitting a summary, you will sometimes be redirected to re-read a portion of the text. After you finish re-reading, press the "I finished rereading" button to proceed to the next page.

### 3. Dashboard

#### Statistics

  An overview of the dashboard.
</Image>

From the statistics dashboard, you can access different learning statistics such as your progress (i.e., how many sections you have completed so far), summary statistics (the number of summaries you have submitted and the number of summaries that have passed the evaluation, etc.), and daily reading time. There will also be a quick link to your recent summaries available at the bottom right corner.

#### Summaries

You will be able to access your past summaries in the summaries tab (<span style= {{ color: 'red' }}>**1**</span>) of your dashboard. Below is an overview of the Summaries page’s layout.

<Image src="/images/userguide/userguide12.png">

(<span style= {{ color: 'red' }}>**1**</span>) Summaries tab. You can access the summaries page by clicking on this tab (or by clicking on your profile icon on the top right corner, then clicking on a separate summaries button)
(<span style= {{ color: 'red' }}>**2**</span>) Your past summaries are categorized by modules. Use this dropdown menu to access summaries from different modules (default is set to Module 1).
(<span style= {{ color: 'red' }}>**3**</span>) Click on this button to move to a specific section and write a new summary.
(<span style= {{ color: 'red' }}>**4**</span>) This part shows the time your past summaries were written on, and whether they passed (light blue check mark) or failed (light pink x mark) the AI’s evaluation.

#### Questions

In the `Questions` tab, you will have access to all the constructed response items that you have responded to while reading the text. Each row will contain your answer to a constructed response item. Clicking on the row will take you to the relevant chunk. The emojis to the right side denotes your score (poor, fair, excellent).
