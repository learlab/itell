### Overview

#### Introduction

This document provides guidelines for using Intelligent Text for Enhanced Lifelong Learning (iTELL) for Prolific users. We cover the iTELL adaptation of Principles of Macroeconomics. The textbook was redesigned into an interactive web version by a team comprising a subject matter expert, a content and assessment developer, a multimedia and web developer, and an instructional designer from Georgia Tech.

#### Acknowledgements

We would like to thank [the authors and contributors of the original textbook](https://openstax.org/books/principles-macroeconomics-2e/pages/preface). We also appreciate Affordable Learning Georgia, the National Science Foundation, and The National AI Institute for Adult Learning and Online Education (AI-ALOE) for providing funds to support this project.

### 2. Making Progress in iTELL

#### Pages

The textbook's contents are divided into Pages. You can access different Pages using the left-side navigation bar.

Below is an overview of what a Page in an iTELL book looks like.

<Image src="/images/userguide/userguide_prolific_2_simple.png">
  What each Page looks like.
</Image>

(<span style= {{ color: 'red' }}>**1**</span>) The progress bar (in (<span style= {{ color: '#60a5fa' }}>**blue**</span>)) shows how far you have scrolled down the page.
(<span style= {{ color: 'red' }}>**2**</span>) The left-side navigation bar will have links to different Chapters and Sections within the Module. Pages with checkmarks mean that you have completed those pages. Pages with locks mean that you have to complete the preceding page to unlock those pages.
(<span style= {{ color: 'red' }}>**3**</span>) If you get stuck at any point, click on this **Reset page** button to restart your progress for the page.
(<span style= {{ color: 'red' }}>**4**</span>) Click on this quick link to move to the top of the page.
(<span style= {{ color: 'red' }}>**5**</span>) The right-side navigation bar will have quick links to different subsections within the page.

#### Making Progress

In most Pages, you will be asked to read the page and also read **1)** constructed response items and **2)** a  reference summary. You will not be able to proceed to the next page without successfully completing all tasks on your current page.

##### 1) Read

Most of the contents in a page will be blurred at the beginning. As you read through the page, click on the red button (**1**) that reads "Click here to continue reading" to _unblur_ the next section (**2**) and continue reading.

</Image>

##### 2) Read Constructed Response Items

Some parts of the text will have constructed response items instead of the "Click here to continue reading" button. These items are short written questions where you provide a brief explanation of a concept to demonstrate your understanding of the text that you have read. Read the constructed response item and click on the "Continue" button to proceed to the next section.

##### 3) Read a Reference Summary

A reference summary is located at the bottom of each page. Read the reference summary and click on the "Mark as completed" button to proceed to the next page.
