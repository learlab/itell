summary: The collection of studies explores advancements in linguistic and text analysis tools with implications for diverse applications, from educational psychology to natural language processing. TAALES 2.0 enhances the measurement of lexical sophistication, predicting significant variance in lexical proficiency, while improvements in part-of-speech tagging and syntactic complexity analysis offer more accurate and efficient language processing. The multidimensional analysis of university discourse highlights the distinct challenges of spoken versus written academic registers. Additionally, the study on academic writing challenges stereotypes about its complexity and explicitness, emphasizing phrasal over clausal elaboration. Understanding coherence's role in essay quality underscores its predictive power over cohesion. These insights collectively inform language assessment, pedagogy, and writing evaluation, urging further research in linguistic sophistication and academic communication.
