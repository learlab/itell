The discussion shifts to mental and physical resilience, exemplified by George Hood's record-breaking plank, highlighting the role of mental toughness and Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). BDNF, a protein fostering brain health and resilience, increases with exercise, especially those requiring mental effort, like planking. The narrative includes patients battling severe conditions, underlining the potential of planking and its mental demands to elevate BDNF and improve life quality. Despite ongoing research, the link between grit, BDNF, and physical exercises remains compelling, advocating further study to harness these benefits.",
